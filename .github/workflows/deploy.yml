### **Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages Settings**

1. Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under "Build and deployment", set **Source** to: **GitHub Actions**
3. Save (if there's a save button)

### **Step 3: Trigger Deployment**

Either:
- Push a commit to trigger the workflow
- Go to **Actions** tab → Select the workflow → Click "Run workflow"

Your site will be live at `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/` in 1-2 minutes.

## **Even Faster: Use Claude Code**

Since you have GitHub integrated, you can ask Claude Code to do this:
```
"Set up GitHub Pages deployment for this repository using GitHub Actions. 
Create the workflow file and configure it to deploy the main branch."
